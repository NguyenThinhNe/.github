## 🎯 Project Overview & Goals
ELV Warranty Management System helps local service staff handle warranty requests efficiently and transparently. It allows them to record customer issues, verify warranty eligibility, and submit claims directly to the manufacturer. The system tracks the status of each request—from submission and inspection to approval and replacement—ensuring quick resolution and accurate documentation. By digitizing the entire process, local staff can reduce paperwork, improve communication with the manufacturer, and deliver faster, more reliable service to customers.

Goal:
+ Digitize the warranty workflow to reduce manual paperwork.
+ Improve response time for warranty approvals.
+ Provide transparency for both service centers and the manufacturer.

## 🌊 Warranty Workflow
1. Local Staff logs a new warranty claim → fills in customer, vehicle, and defect details.
2. Backend validates claim, assigns claim ID, stores data, and uploads related files.
3. Manufacturer Reviewer checks eligibility and approves/rejects the request.
4. System updates claim status and notifies the local staff.
Service Center receives replacement parts or reimbursement.

## üéØ Project Overview & Goals
ELV Warranty Management System helps local service staff handle warranty requests efficiently and transparently. It allows them to record customer issues, verify warranty eligibility, and submit claims directly to the manufacturer. The system tracks the status of each request‚Äîfrom submission and inspection to approval and replacement‚Äîensuring quick resolution and accurate documentation. By digitizing the entire process, local staff can reduce paperwork, improve communication with the manufacturer, and deliver faster, more reliable service to customers.
